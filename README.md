# ECG-Heartbeat-Classification-using-1D-CNN
This project focuses on the detection and classification of cardiovascular diseases using ECG heartbeat signals from the [MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shayanfazeli/heartbeat). The dataset is provided in CSV format where each row represents one heartbeat as a 1D time-series signal.
